# attention-based-feature-fusion
A scratch implementation and extended work of paper "Classification of ocular diseases employing attention-based unilateral and bilateral feature weighting and fusion"

Highly imbalance dataset was provided by Kaggle for eye disease classification, and attention based feature fusion pipeline was proposed using a resent as feature extractor. Finally few fully connected layers were added for classification. In addition to implementing this work, I used feature ensembling and utilized two resnet (one with fixed parameter as did in paper and second was trainable to get room for complex learning).
